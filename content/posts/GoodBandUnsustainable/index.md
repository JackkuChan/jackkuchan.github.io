Sustainability has been a hot commodity these days. With relatively new investment
vehicles, such as [green bonds](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/11/what-are-green-bonds-climate-change/) and sustainability [investment funds](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/funds/esg.aspx), investors seem to be more keen than
ever on the various environmental and social responsibilities imposed upon companies.

Regulations, rating agencies and monitoring entities are popping up as well, serving to
prop up the sustainability-environment. However, itâ€™s not all sunshine and rainbows;
growing headwinds might indicate a slow-down or even a pivot away from sustainability,
like the recent EU comission pushback against their own [reporting regulations](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_614)

Not only that, a fundamental change towards the structure of companies in general is
underway as well. The reigning companies tend to be [younger](https://www.kingslandgrowth.com/news/2022/1/6/sampp-500-returns-continue-to-be-driven-by-younger-companies),
indicating that, in practical terms, sustainability in terms of longevity has actually been
going down for a while now. Therefore, it is safe to say that sustainability is living in paradoxical times - indeed, cause and consequence are hard to pinpoint. Do we care more about sustainability because we have a newly kindled appreciation for it, or is the need driven by a practical demand for stability and long-term perspectives?

Nowadays, sustainability and ESG are near ubiquitous. ESG, of course, standing for the major categories of sustainability that we have come to appreciate: Environmental, social and governance. While the terminology seems fresh, it is actually only a culmination of previous learnings and experiences throughout history. 

Take the [Acid Rain](https://www.ecohubmap.com/hot-spot/acid-rain-in-the-black-forest-in-southwestern-germany/3u53mmlc4vehlp) in germany, for example, only a few decades ago, demolishing the historically significant black forest. Evidently a sign of environmental damage still fresh in the memory, like the [Flint water crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_water_crisis). Indeed, we must be ever vigilant even in modernity, as the smog clouds of English yore, or the strip-mining devastation of landscape, are all too possible to happen today, and still do in some parts of the world. 

Using a brief literary reference, it is said that J.R.R Tolkien himself wrote the Hobbits as a view into the idyllic British landscape, and the later part of *Return of the King* (the part which was not included in the trilogy of movies) is about the devastation of that landscape through rapid industrialization, clearly the environment has been in our hearts and minds for generations, with both old and recent concerns rearing their heads.

Well, what about Social and Governance, surely they must be modern inventions: reflections of our fresh mindsets? Not necessarily, it has been historically understood in many places that increasing worker welfare, alongside that of the society as a whole, could have many beneficial effects for the company. Henry Ford, for example, was famous for [advocating](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/108-years-ago-ford-doubled-employee-wages-overnight-business-case-for-higher-pay.html) for his workers rights. Doubling their pay and reducing their hours, seeing then a significant drop in the turnover rate. A similar mindset was seen in Japan, where traditionally companies would consider themselves as a family with an united purpose, sometimes even refusing to fire employees [at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUrl1JwmJs). Factories often employed entire towns and villages, forming a synergistic relationship between the worker and the company, cementing strong ties through life-long employment, location and occupation. 

This then leads to the question: Are we actually more sustainable these days? While the Environmental concerns are acute and on the news, maybe more so than ever with global warming, is it possible that companies have actually retreated from previous heights of sustainability? In many factors, we have gained leaps and bounds - workplace gender equality has undeniably improved, as have the standards of corporate reporting, but what could we have lost along the sands of time?

Sustainability for the labor force, for one, no longer can an employer be thought as a sustainable source of employment for the average person, with the tenure rates [falling yearly](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/tenure.pdf). As aforementioned in the initial passage, younger companies are also taking the spotlight, leading to a push-and-pull pressure that shortens tenures even more. That's not to even mention the advent of new "*disruptive*" innovations and technologies, such as AI, that might have all kinds of effects. 

So, is there something that can be done about this unsustainability, for us to truly be sustainable? Probably not - sustainability can also be considered stagnation. Indeed, the common consideration is to advocate for "Sustainable growth" as a way to appease that view, but that is merely an appeasement through a shifting of words and the underlying message remains the same, alongside the problem. The only constant in life is change, after all, and maybe this drive towards sustainability is our own desire to slow down these tumultous times so that they don't leave us in the dust, or smog, or lead-poisoned water...
