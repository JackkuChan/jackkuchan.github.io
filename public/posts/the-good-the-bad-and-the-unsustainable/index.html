<p>Sustainability has been a hot commodity these days. With relatively new investment
vehicles, such as <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/11/what-are-green-bonds-climate-change/" target="_blank">green bonds</a> and sustainability <a href="https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/funds/esg.aspx" target="_blank">investment funds</a>, investors seem to be more keen than
ever on the various environmental and social responsibilities imposed upon companies.</p>
<p>Regulations, rating agencies and monitoring entities are popping up as well, serving to
prop up the sustainability-environment. However, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows;
growing headwinds might indicate a slow-down or even a pivot away from sustainability,
like the recent EU comission pushback against their own <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_614" target="_blank">reporting regulations</a></p>
<p>Not only that, a fundamental change towards the structure of companies in general is
underway as well. The reigning companies tend to be <a href="https://www.kingslandgrowth.com/news/2022/1/6/sampp-500-returns-continue-to-be-driven-by-younger-companies" target="_blank">younger</a>,
indicating that, in practical terms, sustainability in terms of longevity has actually been
going down for a while now. Therefore, it is safe to say that sustainability is living in paradoxical times - indeed, cause and consequence are hard to pinpoint. Do we care more about sustainability because we have a newly kindled appreciation for it, or is the need driven by a practical demand for stability and long-term perspectives?</p>
<p>Nowadays, sustainability and ESG are near ubiquitous. ESG, of course, standing for the major categories of sustainability that we have come to appreciate: Environmental, social and governance. While the terminology seems fresh, it is actually only a culmination of previous learnings and experiences throughout history.</p>
<p>Take the <a href="https://www.ecohubmap.com/hot-spot/acid-rain-in-the-black-forest-in-southwestern-germany/3u53mmlc4vehlp" target="_blank">Acid Rain</a> in germany, for example, only a few decades ago.</p>
